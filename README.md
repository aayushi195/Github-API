# Github-API

I have a created Github Card Component using HTML, CSS and Jquery. 

Features :

1. Any number of the Github Users can be added through the Username. 
  Once Added, the Name, Location and Followers of the User are displayed.
2. Sorting is provided using Name, Location and Followers.
3. The Github Card can also be deleted by clicking the Cross.
4. Whenever the Card is clicked, It is redirected to the required User's Github Profile.
